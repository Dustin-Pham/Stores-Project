# Stores-Project

# Description
Here I pulled the dataset 'supermarket store branches sales analysis' from kaggle and used python incorporated with pandas, as well as excel in order to create 
an anaylsis of what affects supermarket store sales the most. 

By importing pandas, I am allowed to create an analysis over the data and search for the mean of the columns in order to count the total number of store sales. 

By individually creating the mean, I am allowed to search for the total amount of stores that are above the mean. 

Afterwards, I create a search of the columns that are above the mean.

After creating those, I would save them into excel files where I would have a better layout to view the data.

After importing the data, I created graphs of each of the data comparing the different coloumns.

This allows a visualization of the data which allows an easier understanding of the data that has been discovered.
