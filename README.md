### Stores-Project

### Goal 
The goal of this project was to display my knowledge in python and excel. 


### Process
Here I attempted to find what impacts store sales the most, and what should mainly be focused on in order to increase store sales.
Process
Here I pulled the dataset 'supermarket store branches sales analysis' from kaggle and used python incorporated with pandas, as well as excel in order to create an anaylsis of what affects supermarket store sales the most.

We are given data on Store ID, Store Area, Daily Customer Count, Items Available, and Store Sales.

Store ID isn't necessary data for our findings so we could just ignore it. The main data that we will focus on is Store Area, Daily Customer Count, Items Available, and Store Sales.

By importing pandas, I am allowed to create an analysis over the data and search for the mean of the columns in order to count the total number of store sales.

By individually creating the mean for each column, I am allowed to search for the total amount of stores that are above the mean.

Afterwards, I create a search of the columns that are above the mean.

After creating those, I would save them into excel files where I would have a better layout to view the data.

After importing the data, I created graphs of each of the data comparing the different coloumns.

This allows a visualization of the data which allows an easier understanding of the data that has been discovered.

By having a visualization out, we could see which one has a similar chart as well as look at numbers that allows a more percise finding.
