### Goal 
The goal of this project was to display my knowledge in python and excel. I wanted to see which category had the most impact on store sales. By creating this discovery, Stores would be able to utilize this information to priotize what they should change in order to increase store sales.


### Process
I imported the data from Kaggle and used python incorportated with pandas, as well as excel in order to create an analysis of what affects supermarket store sales the most. I printed out the summary of each of the columns. By printing the summary, I am able to analyze the data of each of the categories and utalize the mean resutls. The main columns I decided to focus on was Store Area, Daily Customer Count, Items Available, and Store Sales.

Using the mean, I searched the each columns for numbers above the mean. The reason is because I wanted to see if a column were to do particularly better tahn its average, how much the store sales would increase. 

I created csv files and opened them up in excel in order to get a btter layout of the data. I also decided to create a graph in order to have a better visualization of the discoveries.

We are given data on Store ID, Store Area, Daily Customer Count, Items Available, and Store Sales.

Store ID isn't necessary data for our findings so we could just ignore it. The main data that we will focus on is Store Area, Daily Customer Count, Items Available, and Store Sales.By having a visualization out, we could see which one has a similar chart as well as look at numbers that allows a more percise finding.
